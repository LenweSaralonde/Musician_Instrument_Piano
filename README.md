Musician Piano
==============
This plugin adds a piano instrument to [Musician](https://github.com/LenweSaralonde/Musician), based on the legendary Yamaha C7 Grand Piano.

The piano is mapped to MIDI program 0 (Grand Piano). The players who don't have the plugin installed will just hear the default hammered dulcimer sound instead.

If you use [MusicianList](https://github.com/LenweSaralonde/MusicianList), you'll need to manually edit each song you want to use the piano.

More free RAM is needed to make this extra instrument to work properly.
